# r4pi deb package

A meta-package that serves several useful purposes:

* It makes it easy for users to install our build of R as this package depends on it
* It provides an easy way for us to deliver R package run-time dependencies to end users since this package can depend on those too
* It might allow us to do some interesting things in the future
